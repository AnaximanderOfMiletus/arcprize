
Possible ideas:

1. Collect basic properties of input and output arrays - dimensions, mensioned numbers (quantity of each), groups (as in Go), enclosures, concave/convex, sorting, isPredictable (symmetry, progression, tiling, etc.)
2. Based on the above form possible transformation rules (with possible parameters)
3. Apply rules and compare
4. If combination found - indicate critical and flexible parameters


Options:

Flip: Horizontal, Vertical
90Â° Rotate: Clockwise, Counter-Clockwise, Upside Down
Crop
Scale
stack on top
tile
symmetry
