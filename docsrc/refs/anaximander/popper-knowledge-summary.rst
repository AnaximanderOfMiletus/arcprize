Karl Popper's Ideas on Knowledge and Adaptation
===============================================

.. note:: notes from Anaximander

Nature of Knowledge
-------------------

1. Knowledge often has the character of expectations.
2. Expectations are usually hypothetical or conjectural.
3. Most knowledge, for both humans and animals, is hypothetical.
4. Knowledge can be objectively true despite being uncertain.
5. Truth and certainty are distinct concepts.

Characteristics of Knowledge
----------------------------

6. Much of our knowledge is true, but little is certain.
7. Truth is objective and corresponds to facts.
8. Certainty is subjective and can lead to dogmatism.
9. All organisms possess knowledge, including animals and plants.

Evolution of Knowledge
----------------------

10. Knowledge is adaptive and evolved over generations.
11. Sense organs evolved alongside knowledge of environmental conditions.
12. Prior knowledge is necessary for sensory perception.
13. Short-term adaptations are built on long-term adaptations.
14. Knowledge precedes and is built into sensory organs.

Relationship between Knowledge and Life
---------------------------------------

15. Prior knowledge is required for observation and perception.
16. Long-term knowledge cannot be derived solely from short-term knowledge.
17. All adaptations to environmental and internal regularities are forms of knowledge.
18. Life requires adaptation to the environment.
19. The evolution of knowledge coincides with the evolution of life and our planet.

Key Takeaways
-------------

- Knowledge is hypothetical and adaptive.
- Truth and certainty are separate concepts.
- Prior knowledge is crucial for perception and learning.
- Knowledge evolves alongside life and adapts to the environment.
